#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science focuses on the systematic design, development, testing, maintenance, and management of software applications.
importance of software engineering in the technology industry.
enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainmentand healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. development of programming languages.Object-oriented programming (OOP) emerged as a paradigm shift in the way software was designed and implemented. OOP introduced the concept of organizing software design around "objects" rather than actions and data rather than logic.
2.Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960. eg web development.
3.The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.Structured programming emerged in the late 1960s as a response to the increasing complexity of software systems. Before this, software was often written in an unstructured, "spaghetti code" style, making it difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.
4.The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.Agile methodologies represent a significant shift from traditional, linear approaches to software development, like the Waterfall model. Agile emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and iterative development, enabling teams to respond quickly to changes and deliver value continuously.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.requirements- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2.Design- creating high-level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation- writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment- releasing the software tousers or customers.
6.Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of the software development lifecycle must be completed before the next begins while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that focuses on continuous delivery of small, usable parts of the software, often called “increments” or “sprints.”
Waterfall is suitable for projects with clear, unchanging requirements, such as government contracts or regulated industries where scope changes are minimal while Agile is ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change frequently, such as startups developing new products or services. Developing a software system for a medical device where all regulatory requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change using waterfall model, Developing a new e-commerce platform where user preferences and market trends are expected to evolve using Agile model

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.

Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by design and executing test plans.

Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. eg Visual studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
version control systems(VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.eg Git,subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced by software engineers include;
changing requirements during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Accured from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions,technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. 
startegies to overcome the above challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
Intergration testing tests interactions between different components or subsytems.
system testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing, involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.prompt engineering is the process of  crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
importance of interacting with AI models.
1. precision and accuracy of responses. A well-crafted prompt provides clear context and sets expectations for the AI, leading to more accurate and relevant responses.
2.Prompt engineering allows users to tailor the AI's responses to specific tasks such as translation.
3.Well-crafted propmts can inspire the AI to generate creative ideas,solution or content.
4.prompt engineering plays a critical role in minimizing the risk of biased or harmful outputs.
5. Promp engineering involves iteratively testing and refining prompts to improve the model's performance over time.This process helps identify patterns in how the AI responds and allows users to develop strategies for consistently getting high-quality outputs.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
